### Model Selection: 
* ROC = Receiver Operating Characteristic curve. Plots the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate for different thresholds. The best model is one with a greater AUC/ looks more like a rectangle. 
* True Positive Rate = Recall 
* False Positive Rate = Fallout - of all the 0’s the model should’ve given, how many times did you predict a 1. 
* 1 - Fallout = Specificity - of all the 0’s you should’ve given how many times did you actually predict 0.
